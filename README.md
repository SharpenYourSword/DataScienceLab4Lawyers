Lab Sessions for Learning Data Science as a Non-Techie

## About
I've long wanted to do a hands-on introduction to data and compute for non-techies. An invitation to be a guest lecturer in Tanina Rostein's Iron Tech Lawyer class at Georgetown Law School has provided the chance. 

This repo contains notes for a roughly 2 hour, interactive, hands-on introduction to data and compute from the perspective of a developer/data scientist. 

It does not matter if you have never programmed or used the command line. Only basic omputer skills are required.

## Goals
This session is an introduction designed to give non-techies "Aha!" moments with data and the cloud. It bravely uses the command line to show you how easy it all is. Basic command line skills empowers you to take full advantage of virtualized computing assets.

Watching a video of downhill skiing doesn't give you the excitement of the flying down a mountain. Reading about Skype does not communicate the power of a free video call with an old friend overseas. 

Open data, big data, and the cloud (virtualized compute and storage) is effecting everything we do. Reading about these trends is easy, but it seems too technical and complicated for a "non-technie" to do any of it. Sadly, that leaves many executives, managers, policy makers, and researchers without that "Aha!" moment for data and the cloud that they have had for the web, social media, and smartphones. 

If you think data and the cloud is very technical, compliated -- you'll act like it is. You will treat data and the cloud as expensive and precious reources instead of the increasingly cheap commoodities they are readily available to you and that you can combine into value-added products and services.

Try this hands on lab session and start to add data and the cloud to your toolkit.

## Instructor Led
The session is designed to be instructor led to answer questions and explain things.

You can try the material on your own, but it is more notes than step-by-step self-paced. Just follow the *checklist.md* and jump back and forth between *outline.md* and *snippets.md* and you will probably learn something.

## Typing is Learning
The brain has evolved to find and digest patterns from a complicated, busy world. You need to feed it those patterns repeatedly to develop a new skill. You can't learn to tie your shoes only by watching someone else do it. You've got to practice with your own hands.

In other words, TYPE THE EXAMPLES. What first seems bizare soon becomes recognizable patterns, understanding and muscle memory. Eventually, the commands are as second nature tying your shoes. 

Typing is control, too. This lab introduces essential key strokes that will make you super powerful and save you time.

#### What about complicated commands sequences that are hard to type correctly?  
It's frustrating finding and correcting errors in long, complicated commands. When this arrises, I combine typing with copy and paste. Copy and paste the long command into a plain text editor. Then on a new line right below, type the command character by character. Do this one or more times to grok the command. Then copy and paste what you typed into the command line to avoid typos.

## The Files

Use *checklist.md* to get your computer ready for the lab. Print out the *commandline-cheatsheet.md* (e.g. first 2 pages) so you have handy visual reference to help you with the commands. The data files you need are listed in *urls.md". 

My notes for teaching the lab are in *outline.md*. 	Command line steps are captured in *snippets.md*.
